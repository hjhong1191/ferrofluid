      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>A ferrofluid is a liquid which contains incredibly small pieces of a magnetic substance. Common metals used are cobalt, magnetite and iron. It is important that these pieces of metal be small enough that they remain in a liquid state when exposed to a magnet. This threshold is somewhere on the order of ten nanometers.

      <h2>What can it be used for?</h2>
      <p>There are many commercial applications for ferrofluids--speakers and hard drives being the most common. The oily fluid prevents debris from entering hard drives when a small amount is placed between the magnets and shaft. In the case of speakers ferrofluids remove heat from the voice coils and help dampen the cone movement.</p>
